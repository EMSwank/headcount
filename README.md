## Headcount

This is a project from the Turing School of Software and Design Backend Engineering program. The essential purpose of the project was to build a sort of ORM from scratch using CSV files to analyze standardized test score data from the state of Colorado CSAP test results. The project is intended to be the precurser to using ActiveRecord, so students can understand basically what ActiveRecord is doing under the hood. Originally, the project was intended to be done in a group, breaking up the components amongst the group members. I did the project solo.
